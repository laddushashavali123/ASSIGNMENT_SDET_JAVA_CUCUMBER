How to install and run the project
----------------------------------
1. Download Java
    a. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_181
    b. Edit Windows environment variables, JAVA_HOME: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_181
    c. Edit Windows environment variables, Path: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_181\bin
    d. Check JRE: java -version in CMD
    e. Check JDK: javac -version in CMD
2. Download MAVEN
    a. C:\Libs\apache-maven-3.5.4
    b. Edit Windows environment variables, Maven document states add M2_HOME only, but some programs still reference Maven folder with
       MAVEN_HOME, so, itâ€™s safer to add both: C:\Libs\apache-maven-3.5.4
    c. Edit Windows environment variables, Path: C:\Libs\apache-maven-3.5.4\bin
    d. Check maven: mvn -version in CMD
3. Double click in file called 'executable.bat' located in root of the project
4. Check folder 'target\cucumber-report-html\cucumber-reports' and open
   the file 'feature-overview.html' in order to see the results of the test.

-------
v1.2:
- Adding support for Java 11 (for var support)
- Updating Selenium to the latest version 3.141.59
- Adding support for testNG.xml to run from testng and not directly from testRunner. The idea is to have listeners
  and pretty cool stuff added.
